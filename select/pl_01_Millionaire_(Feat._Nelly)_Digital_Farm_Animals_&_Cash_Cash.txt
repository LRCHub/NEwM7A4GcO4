I feel like a millionaire
I feel like a millionaire
Whenever she comes around
Whenever I hear that sound
Smell like money when she walk by
All heat no smoke when she on fire
If they ain't suicide doors then she don't ride
She got that passport pussy or
she don't fly, no lie
She gonna make you pay to see her work it
She only twerkin' for a birkin
I gotta see if shorty worth it
Ayyyy
She must be the money
Shorty worth the weight the way she go down
Shorty worth her weight her weight
in gold pounds
Come here young money put that milli on me
She the reason why I keep a milli on me
She gonna make you pay to see you work it
She only twerkin' for a birkin
Let me see if shorty worth it
Hey she must be the money
She must be the money
Shorty looking like money
