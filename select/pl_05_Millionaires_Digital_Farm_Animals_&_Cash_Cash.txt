Spilling over the lines
Dreaming on the motorway
I got you by my side
Yeah, we could use a holiday
We talk about the lottery
Just a million to get away
In the four-letter kinda way
We're greener than we'll ever be
Alright, alright
Everything is so sweet,
air tight
Driving to the sunset, moonlight
I already know,
know we got it all, so
Don't you worry, we'll be rich,
I swear
If love was money,
we'd be millionaires
And does it even matter
If we never get to where
we said we'd be?
That seven-figure sun at sea
Get away, we're free
We're millionaires, you and me
'Cause we're alright, alright
Everything is so sweet,
air tight
Driving to the sunset, moonlight
I already know,
know we got it all, so
Don't you worry, we'll be rich,
I swear
If love was money,
we'd be millionaires
Lately,
both our hands are shaking
Breaking bodies
just to make some
Money, what a funny kind of
State of mind to make us happy
Don't you worry, we'll be rich,
I swear
If love was money,
we'd be millionaires
It doesn't even matter
If we never get to where
we said we'd be
Yeah, it's alright
'cause love is free
