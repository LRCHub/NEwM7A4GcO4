Her treasure chest was sunken
Equally cursed and blessed
In her Versace dress
Too eager to impress

A vision filled her soapsud hell
Twin tub on spin
Lets all her daydreams in
And how she wants away from him

She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire

High street prams
Chariot scene from Ben Hur
Push chair rage
A customized roll bar cage
Will help baby come of age

So what's in the pram?
Is it teen death bazooka?
The check out queue
There's no need to argue
About who was in front of who

She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
(She's a millionaire)
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire

The ad begs, "Buy bottled water"
But we know that it tastes of piss
Should be gettin' our tampons free
D.I.Y. gynecology

She's on it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She got it, she's on it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She's on it, she's on it
(She's a millionaire)
She got it, she got it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's on it, she's on it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire

She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire
She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire

(Aah)
She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire

(Aah)
She's on it, she's on it
She got it, she got it
She's on it, she got it
She's a millionaire
